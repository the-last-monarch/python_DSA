# Question: 
# Rotate Matrix/ Image - LeetCode 48
# You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
# You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly.
# DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

# Example:
#     Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
#     Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

# Solution:
def rotate(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    for i in range (n):
        for j in range (i, n):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    for row in matrix:
        row.reverse()
